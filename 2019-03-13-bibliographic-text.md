Title: Going Viral

As I read the texts for this week, the question of virality: what we choose to promulgate, what we choose to reproduce, and what we choose 
to remember kept bubbling to the surface. The central theme which binds together the texts asks us to ponder what it means for a text 
to go viral, not just on the level of remaining "talked about," but the infrastructure needed to produce and re-produce that text is questioned.

Why were texts reprinted anonymously or miscredited to authors who do not write them? Meredith L. McGill tells us in "The Matter of the Text" 
that "antebellum ideas about intellectual property helped to produce a distinctive literary culture" which are not easily explained through 
modern ideas of texts, canons, and authority (as well as authorship) (1). The antebellum literary marketplace was decentered (2), it did not 
see reprinting as piracy, as reprinting was completely legal (3). McGill argues that this marketplace was completely unconscious and deserves 
more attention by deconstructionists and New Historians, who often ignore the events which influenced material production: 
"re-imagining literary texts as sites in which a range of discourses contend with one another often renders the material conditions of their 
production oddly transparent" (6). She directs our focus to copyright law, which has changed dramatically since the nineteenth century, and 
represent corporate interests which reach beyond the life of the author (10). Instead, Dickens was both unaware and completely without control 
when it came to the works which appeared under his name: as such, McGill takes care to avoid assuming what an author had agency in publishing (17). 
Indeed, McGill takes Foucault's argument regarding authorship a step further, to wonder what it would look like if critics did not assume that 
authors determined production, and to look at the material circumstances of said production (19). McGill goes on to argue that *publishers,* not 
authors held production agency, down to determining whether or not authors should be credited. This rhetorical power could lead publishers to 
shape a publication through popular foreign books which had already claimed an American audience as a savvy financial investment (28). Therefore, 
these rogue viral texts were often not just legal and accepted, but highly intentional financial investments. Illustrations, expensive to make 
and produce, added authority and value to a printed text (29). Gift books constituted a particular economical investment: decontextualized 
plate engravings accompanied anonymous poems, all intended to raise and heighten affect in a female viewer as gifted to her by her male 
admirer (

Ryan Cordell and Abby Mullen ask us to consider not just why viral texts were reproduced in newspapers throughout the 
nineteenth century, but how they were reproduced in "'Fugitive Verses':The Circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers." 
While these poems may not be reproduced in critical texts today, they held a very real presence. So argue Cordell and Mullen of the poem 
"The Children," which "was reprinted at least 171 times in American periodicals between September 22, 1864, and December 3, 1899, making 
it one of the most widely reprinted poems from the nineteenth century thus far discovered by the Viral Texts project at Northeastern 
University." In an updated number on the "Viral Texts" page for this poem, "The Children" was reprinted in "265 newspapers during the 
nineteenth century." The poem sketches the children as miniature angels, part of the glory of heaven that has strayed down to earth. As 
Cordell and Mullen point out in "Fugitive Verses," "we find that accuracy and consistency of attribution were enjoyed by a small minority 
of the poets whose work circulated most broadly in newspapers." This lack of consistent attribution led to instances where poems lost their 
authors as they were reproduced throughout texts. In the case of "The Children," according to the Viral Texts website, "It circulated briefly 
under its author's name, Charles M. Dickinson, or his "Village Schoolmaster" pen name. Soon, however, newspapers began ascribing the poem 
to the more famous name Charles Dickens..." The work of more famous authors were often maintained under their name, as in the case of 
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose name was often appended by the title of "Professor," seeming only to bolster his nineteenth century reputation 
as one of America's greatest poets. Cordell and Mullen suggest the name "Fugitive Verses" for these anonymous or miscredited texts, to demonstrate
the "textual and authorial fluidity of newspaper poetry" which often appeared to be authoritative, but in fact exercised a good deal of 
creative license in assigning a text an author. 

In the case of "The Children, 114 newspaper reprints attributed the poem to Dickens, 29 cite Dickinson, 2 cite an anonymous village schoolmaster, 
and 26 completely excise the author. Cordell and Mullen also reiterate a short narrative that the poem had been found posthumously on the desk 
of Charles Dickens, which makes for a thrilling story which lends authorial significance to the poem. However, a glance at the poem itself brings 
this story into question. Even at his most melodramatic, Dickens tends towards the terse, the short line, and the unrelenting character study. 
This poem presents children and childhood as a completely innocent and unassailable state, as shown in the lines, "And when they are gone, 
I sit dreaming/ Of my childhood, too lovely to last!" Dickens did not have a lovely childhood. He worked in a blacking warehouse while his father 
was in debtor's prison. A fugitive verse is an apt term for the authority which the poem took on under the name "Dickens"- as Cordell and Mullen argue, 
"newspaperâ€™s material and social operations undermine such controls."
