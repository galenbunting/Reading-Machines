# Lab Proceedings

On the first day of our class, we pursued the establishment of our GitHub repositories. This activity invites us to begin the process of writing our 
fieldbook entries, and planning the physical creation of our texts in the digital arena. The mechanism of storing knowledge in a digital format as 
we create entries via bibliographic entries to reflect on the text we encounter in the course, and as we consider the lab activities which we intend 
to complete throughout this course. 

Professor Cordell asked us to pull up the GitHub website and sign up for a GitHub account. We could also sign up for a free student acccount, which 
I signed up for as well. We were then able to create repositories. Professor Cordell also requested we download the GitHub desktop, in order to easily 
upload files to our repositories. As a result of the older machine I was using and the small amount of memory available, it took a little while for the 
desktop version of GitHub to download: in fact, the download failed three times. I tried it a fourth time, and this time, the GitHub desktop downloaded 
directly to my computer. After creating a file on my laptop to back up Markdown files, I was able to create my first GitHub file. Professor Cordell then 
led us through various ways of using Markdown.

# Reflections
The use of digital media to create a fieldbook to chronicle our encounter with different media is an example of what Alan Liu calls "a thick, unpredictable 
zone of contact -more borderland than border line- where (mis)understandings of new media are negotiated along twisting, partial, and contradictory vectors." 
The process of learning to use GitHub (and failing at times) is a part of the new media encounter in a messy zone of contact, which can further our literacy 
with digital media as a class. As Liu says, "We may say that media contact zones are like the pagus in classical times: the tricky frontier around a town 
where one deals warily with strangers because even the lowliest beggar may turn out to be a god, or vice versa." Very often, trepidation surrounding digital 
media reflects our lack of knowledge surrounding such media. To use GitHub as a tool to work through our entanglements with new media can enable us to consider 
*how* we use new media, how new media appeared in the past, and how the history of new media reflects changing technology. Using GitHub can allow us as a class to 
move towards a "poiesis of digital literary studies" which allows us to examine old and new literary media.  

As we experiment with this medium, the technology which enables us to create our messages is our medium. Without the use of a computer, we would not be able to 
upload, update, and even access the use of Markdown files. Marshall McLuhan's "The Medium is the Message" addresses that "in operational and practical fact, 
the medium is the message" (7). When I was unable to download GitHub's desktop, the medium was visible: when my computer was unable to process GitHub's files, 
I was able to create messages via GitHub. However, as I write this entry, I have to think back and utilize my notes in order to remember this failure 
of technology, as I am seamlessly typing into a Notepad file, backing it up to GitHub as I go without a hitch or delay. In assuming that my medium will not fail me 
(my computer will not crash, the Internet will remain active, GitHub will continue to push files to the cloud from my computer), my message interacts seamlessly with 
my medium. All of these various forms of media interact to create "the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new 
technology," as McLuhan suggests. In interacting with new media (and media that was once new) it is imperative to recall the fact that our medium shapes our messages. 

# Outcomes

As I followed along with the lab, I was able to successfully create a GitHub account, a repository, and download the GitHub desktop application to create a 
more accessible way of interacting with Markdown. I also learned the following methods of marking text in Markdown, as the format does not have any inherent coding 
to shape the text entered. 
I want some **emph text**. 

Just plain text here guys.
