# Lab Proceedings: Not A Good First Impression

In this lab, all members of the class proceeded into the press room, where we each obtained our galleys, where previously we had composed our 
type into lines. While Laura, Avery, and Ken still had to finish their composing, Meg's type was ready to be put to bed. David assisted her in 
using the furniture to brace the movable type into place, in order to keep it from sliding while being printed. After a short debate over colored 
ink, we settled on turquoise. After sliding the chase into place, Professor Cordell spread ink in a spiral over the ink plate of the press,
while he instructed Meg to roll the wheel and press the pedal, after arranging a postcard-sized page of paper in preparation for printing. 
This action rolled the ink smoothly over the ink rollers, spreading it evenly as Cordell turned the plate to permit the ink to spread evenly 
over the rollers on all sides. 

Three chases were available, which were quickly filled by three students: the filled chases took up an entire surface in preparation for printing. 
After the font was put to bed, it became locked and therefore dead, unable to be moved from the chases, and thus rendering the chases unavailable
for other tasks. For a large printing shop, many chases would be needed. 

When a chase was available, David instructed me to place my font in the center of a galley, around which he arranged the chase. To lock the text
in place was a balancing act- literally. We arranged furniture around the text and the woodcuts which I was using, placing it betwen the woodcuts 
to evenly balance the woodcuts with the text. Auspiciously, I had selected woodcuts which were also in 24 point font. It was deceptively difficult to 
lock the quires into place, as locking them too far apart from the chase forced them to snap shut on themselves, while locking them too loosely 
resulted in the center of my text sliding downwards, indenting the very middle of my text, which forced me to slam the entire chase down quickly 
onto the galley to keep the font in place. When I picked up the chase the second time, none of the moveable type moved. I carried my chase over 
to the Pearl letterpress, and with Professor Cordell's help, we slid the chase down until the catch snapped shut. The forward movement of the 
wheel sent me forward, while the downward motion of my foot of the press lent a curious kinetic activity to the act of creating an impression. 
I rolled the rollers down over the type to ink them, then Professor Cordell switched the press over to its printing mode, after placing a 
postcard down. The rhythmic aspect of printing, again, caught me by surprise, but it resulted in a good impression. 

After first impression, we both leaned forward, only to see that the word "rain" was missing the i. I opted to reset my type after first printing, 
and after Professor Cordell sponged off the font, I took the chase back to the table, unlocked the type, and used tweezers to push a letter i
into the space between "ra-" and "n." We slid the chase back into place, but this time, we noticed another compositing error: I had 
mistakenly set "stirring" as "stirirring." Yet again, after seeing the misspelling in the impression, Professor Cordell pulled the chase free
and this time, I had to do some more dramatic restructuring. Someone else was using the tweezers, so I moved some of the furniture so that I 
could grasp the errant "r" and "i" with my fingertips and sort them back into the job tray. Then, I inserted more spacers to restructure the text. 

This time, when Professor Cordell slid the chase into place, I turned the wheel, inked the text, and pressed the pedal down, the impression was 
good. After printing six copies, I stopped printing for the night.

# Reflections

The events of this week's lab invited us to consider the mechanical action of printing, the practical planning and work which printing requires, 
and the way in which one must plan and adjudicate one's time while printing. William Blake's desire for authorial
