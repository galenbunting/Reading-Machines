# Lab Proceedings 

When we entered the letterpress studio which houses Huskiana!, we all assembled along a table. Professor Cordell showed us three matrices, 
(Amaranth Borsuk tells this name is derived from the Latin *mater,* or mother), which had been 3-D printed to allow the alloy of lead and tin 
to fill and create the *font,* one of many interchangable movable type, after filling into the backwards-printed letter. Gutenberg would have 
had a much more difficult time to create his fonts: since he used matrices made out of clay and sand, he would have needed to break them every 
time he wanted to remove his fonts, requiring him to create new molds every time (Borsuk 67). As Professor Cordell showed us the interior of the matrix, 
I thought of the long process of trial and failure it took for the technology of movable type to reach this point. 

Professor Cordell then showed us how a compositor (or typesetters) would have worked from a manuscript, a composing stick in hand, to bind 
the type together with the use of spacers. Part engineering, part spelling, part physics, Professor Cordell shows us how to tilt the composing stick 
in your hand, to keep the letters together as you produce a mirror image of text in your hand, looking for the trench which appears at the
bottom of type and spaces alike to see if you are holding the type correctly. 

The immense California Job Case, each committed to a particular kind and size of font, was heavier than I thought, as was the locked type 
which formed the broadside which announces the opening day of the press. We each held it, passed it down the line, careful not to drop it. 
While we'd discussed dead type, type that's locked down for a particular amount of time and thus unable to be used, this physical reminder 
showed just how carefully the arranged moveable type had been placed and spaced and then locked (with quires) into a bed. Given this heavy 
reminder, Benjamin Franklin's critique of Keimer's printing-house brought on a new meaning. Franklin complains that Keimer's printing-house
"consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using himself, composing an Elegy on 
Aquilla Rose." This task would have rendered a good amount of type to be dead, locked up little by little as Keimer used all his font 
for his own purposes. Upon reconsidering this passage, I suppose it is possible to conclude that Keimer most likely had few pressing jobs 
at hand if he could afford to use all his type on his own poetry.
