# Lab Proceedings

Professor Cordell led us into the Northeastern archive. Seating us before open books, he instructed us to examine pairs of books, to list everything we 
noticed about them, and to try and draw comparisons between the pairs. I first examined the *Dragon Prayer Book* (after 1461) and Ovid's 
*Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* (1546). I then examined Charles Dickens' *Sketches of Young Couples* (1840) and Jacob A. Riis' *How the Other Half Lives* (1904).
I then examined Alexander Jones' *Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph* (1852) and George W. Pierce's *Principles of Wireless Telegraphy* (1910).

For the purposes of the following reflections, I will discuss my examination in opening the *Dragon Prayer Book* (after 1461) and Ovid's 
*Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* (1546) as a pair. I will discuss virtual openings from a Medieval Bestiary (circa 1200) and the Sherborne Missal (circa 1400). 
As an appendix to my analysis, I will discuss my examination in opening Charles Dickens' *Sketches of Young Couples* (1840) and Jacob A. Riis' 
*How the Other Half Lives* (1904).

# The *Dragon Prayer Book* and *Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria*

When examining the *Dragon Prayer Book* and Ovid's *Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* side-by-side with one another, both books are written in Latin and are codices. 
The "Dragon Prayer Book"'s pages are of parchment, which makes the book stiff and hard to open, especially given the large amount of pages which are tightly 
bound together. When touching the page, the impression of the letters where the scribe wrote is palpable. The pages are surprisingly cool. One side of the page is 
smooth, while the other has palpable pores: the side of the page which bears painting is the side with slight pores. Unlike the Ovid, this page has colors, 
including a majuscule letter R in blue, which bears the image of a red dragon, along with floral designs, also in red. Guided lines 
run beneath the text, to allow the writer to follow a straight line in writing the prayers. Red written letters draw the eye down the page. 
Like the "Dragon Prayer Book," the Ovid is also small, the perfect size to rest on a person's palm. Love poetry runs uniformly down the page: a majuscule 
letter L begins the first line on page 320, in a similar fashion to the *Dragon Prayer Book.* The letter U does not appear: instead, it bears the letter V in 
place of U. Curiously, lines run along the margins, as though to mimic the guiding lines found in the *Dragon Prayer Book.* This book is printed, 
so there is no purpose for the lines. Such a use of these lines seems to be a holdout of the era of handwritten texts as print became established as a 
technology. There is no color or illumination in the Ovid. The opposite page, page 321, reads "Liber I." Page 321 seems to be continuing the same poem, 
and does not seem to be a new poem, as there is no new heading, but continues unbroken. While the font in the *Dragon Prayer Book* is a gothic scribe's bookhand, 
the Ovid is printed, but seems to be replicating the curve of handwritten text. The cover of the *Dragon Prayer Book* seems to have 
rebound at some point, owing to its craggy, torn leather cover, while the cover of the Ovid seems to have been rebound as well, owing to its 
cloth cover which seems to have been re-pasted at some juncture in its history. 

In turning to another set of pages in the *Dragon Prayer Book,* the majuscule O and S are illustrated in red. A bar of music also appears on this 
page. The four bars (not five, as in modern music) are also illustrated in red. As ecclesiastical music was written for the human voice, it had
a smaller register than modern music. The majuscule letters E and Q are also illustrated in blue. 
On the opposite page, the majuscule letters A, F, and D are illustrated in blue, while the majuscule Q and L are painted in red. These pages 
seemed smooth, despite their parchment. The smaller letters b and a are both illuminated in red. There is also a bar of music on this page 
in red, also on four bars. Both bars on both pages use neume, or square notes, which were used for chants and thus these pages probably bear chants. 
Therefore, chants appear on both these pages.  Both of these pages have signs of wear from being held open, meaning that this opening was probably used often.

In turning to page 62 in the Ovid, the title of this love poem is Medea, which appears in all capital letters. On page 63, the opposite page, the 
title of the other love poem is Jason, also in all capital letters. These two love poems hold an uneasy juxtaposition with one another. Unlike the 
*Dragon Prayer Book,* the Ovid has no painting- or any color at all. However, as mentioned earlier, the Ovid's printed pages bear a curved font 
in imitation of handwriting, in an italic typeface. They also bear the long s, or medial s, in addition to a lack of J's and U's. These pages 
also bear the guiding lines of the earlier spreads, which can be considered skeuomorphs or remnants of the era of the written manuscript.


# The Sherborne Missal And A Medieval Bestiary 

When opening the Sherborne Missal to pages 276 and 277, these two pages are some of the most lavishly illuminated in the manuscript. Choirs of 
angels with gold illuminated wings fill the margins and separate the text into two columns. A very large majuscule letter B also bears the image of an 
angel. The lower margin bears the images of four men. These four men include the patron of the book, the Abbot of Sherborne, Robert Bruyning, his fellow patron
Richard Mitford, who was bishop of Salisbury. The artist John Siferwas includes a self-portrait and also a portrait of the scribe, John Whas. They, along 
with the angels in worshiping the Trinity. The opposite page is less ornately decorated, but also bears a majuscule letter B, but in a smaller size.
The image of a peacock sitting on a branch runs between the columns of this page. Both of these pages are written in Latin, just like the *Dragon Prayer Book*
 and *Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria.* It was handwritten as well, in a font which seems to be in the style of a Blackletter or Fraktur font, while the Ovid is set 
in italic typeface, and the *Dragon Prayer Book* uses a Dominican written scribe's hand. While the Ovid would have most likely been used by a rich person, 
as printed books were expensive, and likely would have been used only in one person's library, the *Dragon Prayer Book* would have likely been passed down 
through a family, owing to the signs of wear on certain pages. Both the Ovid and the *Dragon Prayer Book* are both small in size, meaning that they could only 
be used by one person at a time. In contrast the Sherborne Missal would have been used to conduct Mass for a congregation. Therefore, it is much larger, 
nearly two feet long and a foot across, while the Ovid and the *Dragon Prayer Book* are both small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. Though a definite
date is not known regarding the completion of the Sherborne Missal, it was probably during the fifteenth century, the same era as the *Dragon Prayer Book.* 
Meanwhile, *Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria* was printed in the sixteenth century, an early printed book, and while it is an octavo, some idiosyncrasies exist, 
such as its guiding lines for writing, useless for a printed book. Neither the Sherborne Missal nor the *Dragon Prayer Book* has a cover page: this 
may be due to the fact that both were commissioned for wealthy patrons, while the Ovid had been printed for a more general buyer. 
In Robert Darnton's "What is the History of Books? Revisited", Darnton argues that paratexuality and intertextuality is an important part of book 
history. The remnants of guiding lines in the Ovid might be a part of the paratextuality of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: during the sixteenth 
century, handwritten and printed book existed in tandem. Guided lines would have been carried over from the influence of written books, as part of what 
defined what a codex was. 


The oldest of the texts I examined was the Medieval Bestiary which was crafted in the thirteenth century. I opened it to pages 11 and 12. 
The illustration on page 11 is an unusual one, a hyena which is shown to be devouring a corpse. It is both male and female, and is shown contorting 
its body in a way which may be intended to frighten the reader. Below the illustration, a majuscule letter E in red stands. The text on this page is 
in a Blackletter scribe's hand, surrounded by marginal lines to guide the writer. Page 12 is also in a Blackletter scribe's hand, has no illustrations 
or distinctive colors, and is also in Latin. This book would have taught religious lessons in conversation with the images of animals. This book is 
9 inches by 4 inches, a much smaller book than the Sherborne Missal. Such a book would have also been commissioned by a rich patron. All four 
of these books would have had an audience of people who were both literate and able to understand Latin, a very small educated group of wealthy 
or aristocratic people. Jessica Pressman argues that the codex is an integral part of defining what it means to have a "bookish" aesthetic in the twenty-first 
century: in this era, Latin was the language of intellect and religion. For a book to be a book, it required guiding lines, the appearance of being handwritten, 
and Latin text. In Latin, such a volume would define its audience within a specific boundary. 

# Appendix: Charles Dickens' *Sketches of Young Couples* and Jacob A. Riis' *How the Other Half Lives*

In examining Charles Dickens' *Sketches of Young Couples* and Jacob A. Riis' *How the Other Half Lives,* while these books are also codices like the 
*Dragon Prayer Book* and Ovid's *Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria,* the pages are much more robust than the Ovid, while they seem less sturdy than the parchment 
of the *Dragon Prayer Book.* I argue that these books were more sturdily made, due to evolving technologies in paper creation. The cover of the Dickens is 
made of a false leather, stamped with a faux gilt pattern, while the flyleaf is made of a faux marbled paper. The edges of the pages are also gilded with 
gold metallic paint. This construction seems to be a relic of its age: according to Leah Price's *How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain,* a 
"good reader," according to Victorian mores, would not care about the cover of a book, while a less cultured or "bad reader" (again, according to Victorian 
mores) would place value in a book which looked to be a valuable book, according to the construction of its binding. Upon opening the Dickens, one finds 
an illustration on page 40 of adults surrounding a child, while script says "Couples who dote upon their children." Meanwhile the other page (page 41) 
bears a heading in all caps in Roman font ("COUPLES WHO DOTE UPON THEIR CHILDREN") and below, text tells a vignette of couples who ruin their health 
by spoiling their children. Meanwhile, the cover of the Riis seems to be made out of an amalgam of paper and paste, bearing illustrations to authenticate 
its veracity. While the Dickens is a series of recounted anecdotes purporting to be true stories, the Riis is a work of investigative journalism of the 
lives of the poor in New York, with photographs as evidence. On page 62, in Roman font, death statistics from the tenement of Bandits' Roost are laid 
out in a table, while text provides a narrative of deaths of children. On page 63, a photograph appears, with a caption beneath, in all capital letters, 
telling us that this picture depicts BANDITS' ROOST. It is in black and white, showing squalid tenements with ragged laundry and a sad-faced child. 
In these nineteenth century print codices, there are no color illustrations.
