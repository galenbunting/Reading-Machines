# Lab Proceedings 

When we entered the letterpress studio which houses Huskiana!, we all assembled along a table. Professor Cordell showed us three matrices, 
(Amaranth Borsuk tells this name is derived from the Latin *mater,* or mother), which had been 3-D printed to allow the alloy of lead and tin 
to fill and create the *font,* one of many interchangable movable type, after filling into the backwards-printed letter. Gutenberg would have 
had a much more difficult time to create his fonts: since he used matrices made out of clay and sand, he would have needed to break them every 
time he wanted to remove his fonts, requiring him to create new molds every time (Borsuk 67). As Professor Cordell showed us the interior of the matrix, 
I thought of the long process of trial and failure it took for the technology of movable type to reach this point. 

Professor Cordell then showed us how a compositor (or typesetter) would have worked from a manuscript, a composing stick in hand, to bind 
the type together with the use of spacers. Part engineering, part spelling, part physics, Professor Cordell shows us how to tilt the composing stick 
in your hand, to keep the letters together as you produce a mirror image of text in your hand, looking for the trench which appears at the
bottom of type and spaces alike to see if you are holding the type correctly. 

The immense California Job Case, each committed to a particular kind and size of font, was heavier than I thought, as was the locked type 
which formed the broadside which announces the opening day of the press. We each held it, passed it down the line, careful not to drop it. 
While we'd discussed dead type, type that's locked down for a particular amount of time and thus unable to be used, this physical reminder 
showed just how carefully the arranged moveable type had been placed and spaced and then locked (with quires) into a bed. Given this heavy 
reminder, Benjamin Franklin's critique of Keimer's printing-house brought on a new meaning. Franklin complains that Keimer's printing-house
"consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using himself, composing an Elegy on 
Aquilla Rose." This task would have rendered a good amount of type to be dead, locked up little by little as Keimer used all his font 
for his own purposes. Upon reconsidering this passage, I suppose it is possible to conclude that Keimer most likely had few pressing jobs 
at hand if he could afford to use all his type on his own poetry. 

Professor Cordell then led us to the room which contained the Pearl letterpress: he showed us how the rollers scroll across the ink pad 
and down over the bed of the type, so that the type is ready to press onto a fresh sheet of paper, all by pumping a foot pedal. 
The movement of the manual press was quick, the metal moving seamlessly. The metaphor of the press as a powerful weapon gained new 
significance. When Marcy Dinus argues that the press is personified as a literary device and as an attestation of  recognized human 
qualities: the motion of the press creates the illusion that it is a living, breathing thing: 
"That the press was understood in early America as such a powerful agent of change suggests a recognition of both its amplificatory 
function—spreading words and ideas from a single source to many others, often across great distances—and the physical strength of the 
men behind these machines." 

# Outcomes

After our introduction to the press and its type, we were each given a tray of fonts: I selected a tray of PT Barnum in size 18, 
selected spacers to surround the form, a galley to place the form, and a composing stick. Professor Cordell gave us each a graph of the
California Job Case, and a octet poem called *A Painter's Epitaph." Each line of the poem bore a pun regarding a term related to printing: 

A Printer's Epitaph. 
Here lies a *form;* place no *imposing stone*
TO mark the *head,* where weary it is lain,
'Tis matter *dead,* its mission being done, 
To be *distributed* to dust again. 
The body is but the *Type,* at best, of man, 
Whose *impress* is the spirit's deathless *page;* 
Worn out, the *type* is thrown to *pi* again, 
The *impression* lives through an eternal age.

To compose a line of type, with the manuscript beside me, was more complicated than I had expected (and I had not expected it to be easy. 
I first tried to begin with the first line, but found that I had placed the type in the composing stick facing the wrong direction, so that
I could not see the raised letters of type. I had to experiment with spacers, as the first time I placed the form down on the galley, the 
movable type... moved. My hands took on a chalky layer of grit from the type, and the adroitness needed to place the form on the galley 
in one apparent piece seemed to be a learned skill for me.


By the end of the lab, I had only succeeded in composing the title of the poem, 
owing to my own need to learn not only the the skill needed to handle type, but to navigate the California Job Case. It was a test of memory, 
as well as physics and engineering. I only began to realize the frustration which Franklin must have felt when he failed to contribute to 
the printing house's drink fund and the pressmen repaid him by "so many little pieces of private mischief... mixing my sorts, transposing
my pages, breaking my matter, etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room." By the lab's conclusion, I had a better understanding, 
not only of the parts of the press and its type, but of the mechanical progress needed to plan one form.
