# Tyger of London

This week, we examine at least three different texts which have changed across their era as they were reproduced: three different matrices
of "The Tiger" and "London," both poems by William Blake, in conversation with "'Q i-jtb the Raven': Taking Dirty OCR Seriously" by Ryan Cordell and 
"The Book as an Expressive Form" by Donald F. McKenzie. In addition, I read Joseph Viscomi's "Illuminated Printing" as my penumbral text. 

"The Tiger" is arranged into six stanzas, which are separated by trailing branches of the tree which fills the right-hand margin. 
A tiger stalks across the lower margin, its stripes of varying colors and brightness: its mouth is closed, and its eyes are large and round. 
Grass spikes up in the left-hand corner, lying flat underneath the tiger itself. This image is consistent in composition across all matrices, 
but the colors differ in printing, rendering the print less visible in the B copy. The tiger itself is also lighter in color, its eyes yellow, 
almost dopy in their wide yellow stare, and the tree is also a light tan. The C copy colors the tiger deeper in patches, its eyes a dark orange, 
while the tree and the grass are also lighter in color. In both the B and the C copies, the text is also a light orange as well, while the trailing 
branches are a light tan. Finally, the F copy is the darkest copy of the three observed copies: the tiger itself nearly vanishes against the 
darkened tree and grass, while the branches that trail along the stanzas are also darker. The text is a dark night blue. Only the tiger's face 
and eyes stand out against the ink. 

"London" is arranged into four stanzas. The page is divided more neatly into illustration and text, as a large image takes up the 
top third of the page. This image depicts a young child, clad in a garment  which falls to his feet, who guides an old, stooped man down a 
dark city street. The man walks on crutches, and wears a long robe which cascades, along with the man's beard, to the ground. The stanzas 
which begin with "In every cry of every man" and "How the chimney sweepers cry" are bordered on the right by a sweeping, curling flame of a 
fire, by which a small boy kneels, extending his hands for warmth. The bottom of the page shows a snake writhing along the ground. Again, the image s
urrounds the text Copy E uses light colors for the header image, mostly in greys, while the child is clad in light blue: a darker blue wash 
lies around and beside the text. The sweeping fire is an orange tint which belches black smoke, while the boy warming his hands is clad in 
green. Finally, a yellow wash covers the serpent, which is brown. The text is also a brown tint. Copy F uses more color for the clothes of 
the people it depicts, while the street is a gritty brown, and the text is tinted green. The fire is illuminated in shades of varigated 
orange and red. Overall, Copy F appears in earthier tones and more staggered lines. Finally, Copy Z depicts color across the entire image. 
A blue wash covers the text, while the old man is dressed in blue and the young boy is dressed in green. Since the street where the two 
stand is illuminated in lighter shades of brown, it is possible to make out a brick wall interrupted by a door. Again, there are observable 
differences across all copies. 

Viscomi tells us that "No printmaker before Blake had incorporated the tools and techniques of writing, drawing, and painting in a graphic medium, 
though the materials and tools were commonplace." In order to create his text, Blake used brown asphaltum-based stop-out varnishes, and wrote 
out his text himself in calligraphy, which he then rewrote backward.
