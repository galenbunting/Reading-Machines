# Lab Proceedings 

David Medina led us all into the brick-walled room where Huskiana is housed, and instructed us to each select a galley, a composing 
stick, and one of the California Job Cases with our chosen sorts. While I chose size 18 Futura for my type, I began by selecting two 
floral decorative elements to further illustrate my chosen text. I had selected the first seven lines of Thomas Stearn Eliot's poem *The Wasteland.* 
This poem is arranged into five sections: the first lines are drawn from the section entitled "The Burial of the Dead." Once type is locked 
into a bed, it is considered "dead" type, so the ironic nature of placing these lines into movable type was not lost on me. 

These lines read: 
April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers. 

I hoped that the floral elements might be reminiscent of the lilacs of the third line.

As I tried to set my first lines, I realized that I had spelled April without an "i," which reminded me of our reading from  "A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy: 
A Visit to the Victoria Printing Press." As the article says, "let your education have been what it may, even classical and mathematical, 
the printer's alphabet is unknown to your studies, and you must learn once more your A B C." I did indeed feel as though I was relearning my 
ABC! I also encountered a problem. By the time I reached the "b" of "breeding, I realized there were no lowercase letter b's in my job case. David 
and I picked over the job case, and after rummaging through it, David proclaimed, "Galen- you're out of sorts." I didn't want to switch to a 
different font in mid-task, but I remembered I had seen Futura Bold in the workroom, also in size 18. I then recomposed the line with a bold substitute
in the form of a bold letter b, which added a particular stress to the beginning of the word, but allowed me to continue setting my type. 

In the middle of setting my type, I looked up and conversed with my classmates. The image of our classroom, rearranged to permit our job trays and 
galleys, reminded me of the image of the women compositers at the Victoria Press. How different we looked! Unlike the women employed as 
compositors at the Victoria Press, my female classmates did not need to wear floor-sweeping dresses which could catch or snag on type or machinery 
in order to make the argument that they belonged in the pressroom. In addition, I remembered that "Women Compositors" argues that women 
should be compositors by laying out the argument that the "the Victoria Press is already self-supporting, which is much as can generally 
be said of any business scarcely eighteen months old." I am not sure we could stand up to such a stringent litmus for success just yet! 

Owing to the way I also spaced my type, I realized I would soon be out of spacers by the end of my task, and I might be unable to finish setting 
the entire text in the way that I wanted. I also realized as I composed that I liked the even formulation of the first four lines, with 
decorative elements assembled on a fifth line. I did not want to be out of sorts, either, and owing to the small number of various letters in the 
tray, I opted to make a change. Here is a rough approximation of how my type looked when I finished: 

April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.

Krischenbaum argues that "A literary history of word processing must therefore acknowledge not only the hybrid, heterogeneous nature of 
both individual persons and their personalities, but also the highly complex scene of writing (and rewriting) that we observe today, 
one where text morphs and twists through multiple media at nearly every stage of the composition and publication process." (45) In this 
literary history in the form of a fieldbook entry on my own work in the press room, I approximate how I adapted and changed my text to fit 
the technology I selected for this lab. 

Given the the fact that we have been reflecting upon human connections to our technology, I had previously considered a quote from the second 
section (*A Game of Chess*) which reads:

At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
Like a taxi throbbing waiting...

My eyes and back certainly did throb like a waiting taxi by the time I finished assembling my type into lines at the end of the lab.
