Title: Computing On the Margins

Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein discuss how Christine Mann Darden's work at the NASA Langley research center may not have seemed 
political in 1967 - at least, not at first. However, Darden's question to her boss when she asked why men with the same credentials as herself 
were assigned engineering positions  while women were assigned to computing positions exposed a latent turmoil beneath the surface. 
While Betty Friedan’s *The Feminine Mystique" had been published in 1963, she had not considered alternate experiences to her own, as 
bell hooks explained in *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center*, "She ignored the existence of all non-white women and poor white women. 
She did not tell readers whether it was more fulfilling to be a maid, a babysitter, a factory worker, a clerk, or a prostitute than to be a 
leisure-class housewife." Similarly, the Combahee River Collective isolated the fact that these systems of oppression interlock with one another: 
"the development of integrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking." (As the Combahee 
River Collective named themselves after Harriet Tubman's campaign in Port Royal, South Carolina, which freed over 750 slaves and was the only 
military campaign in American history planned and led by a woman, this fact was reflected in their name.) After this conversation with her boss, 
Darden was promoted to an aerospace engineering program. She then was able to "conduct ground-breaking research on sonic boom minimization techniques, 
author more than sixty scientific papers in the field of computational fluid dynamics, and earn her PhD in mechanical engineering." However, 
she accomplished all these goals while serving as a parent to her children, meaning that a good deal of her work went unsung, as she worked 
overtime in both the office and the home. 

Darden's scientific accomplishments were still not ranked similarly to her male colleagues: as D'Ignazio and Klein point out, it was the work 
of another woman, a white woman by the name of Gloria Champine, who had "been compiling a set of internal statistics about gender and rank. 
The data showed that men and women with identical academic credentials, publication records, and performance reviews, were still promoted
at vastly different rates." Champine visualized and presented her data to her Directorate: he was shocked, and Darden was promoted. This 
intersectional disparity which Darden experienced goes unnoticed every day. Champine's use of data visualization draws on what D'Ignazio and Klein
point to as the rhetorical force of data science: "data visualizations, and the data science that underlies them, hold tremendous rhetorical 
force. Now, as then, a single data visualization can dazzle, inform, and persuade...Because Champine was able to collect data on both gender and rank, 
she was able to show the extent of the gender discrimination that was taking place at NASA at the time." This data feminism can be a powerful 
force to change the world for good and to create an eglitarian playing field for all sexes, races, and genders. However, data misuse 
can change lives for the worse.  In *Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy*, Cathy O’Neill 
shows how predictive data models place police forces in low-income neighborhoods, which places poorer people at greater risks of being 
ticketed, imprisoned, or killed for being merely suspected of crimes, which O'Neill calls a "pernicious feedback loop" in further criminalizing 
poverty in the United States. 
They sum up their points in concise bullet points: 

* Data feminism isn't only about women.

* Data feminism isn't only for women. 

* Data feminism isn't only about gender.

* Feminism is about power - who has it and who doesn't.

Serena Williams was negatively impacted and nearly died in childbirth: as she pointed out on Facebook, "Black women are over 3 times more likely than 
white women to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes." A death of medical data regarding how bodies, especially those most underprivileged, 
have a real effect upon health:  D'Ignazio and Klein point out "it is people who end up affected by the choices we make in our practices of data 
collection, analysis, and communication." Mimi Onuoha's project, *Missing Data Sets*, points to data sets one expects to see in research, but in 
fact, do not exist. Even if the data does exist, it may not be disaggregated (or analyzed) properly. And sometimes, the way in which such 
data is recorded and kept from those whom it describes, may actually harm those bodies affected by such data, as in the case of the pregnant 
teen whose purchasing data exposed her as being pregnant. Google's Art and Culture App only has 5-6 images of Asian faces in their database, 
while selfie cameras may not register darker skin. Facial recognition software could misidentify or track users, in a disturbing and invasive 
fashion which may remind astute watchers of *1984*'s Big Brother. Preponderance of data may overidentify some, while underidentifying other problems. 


Unseen data, as in the form of a computer's hard drive, may go unseen forever, as Matthew G. Kirschenbaum points out in "Extreme
Inscription: A Grammatology of the Hard Drive": "Most users will never see their hard drive during the life of their computer" (75). 
It therefore remains abstracted and distanced from the daily life of a computer's user, or perceived through the cue of the hard drive 
spinning up. Synthetic recall of data in the form of a computer was anthropomorphized in advertising for the Random Access Memory And Control computer from IBM as a "professor" or "genius" which remind one of Arthur C. Clarke's HAL 9000 (and more dystopically, the God-like 
computer AM in Harlan Ellison's 1967 short story "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.") The ability to "read" a book (figured as disks on 
a computer as pages) betray echos of haunted media, such as Victorian spirit writing.

Kirschenbaum continues, "Digital inscription is a form of displacement. Its fundamental characteristic is to remove digital objects 
from the channels of direct human intervention." (86) The configuation of a God-like or all-powerful computer betrays this phobia of the 
non-human, displaced element of computer cognition. William Gibson (author of cyberpunk 1984 novel *Neuromancer*) tells of expecting a
crystalline formation inside his computer, but "what I got was a little piece of a Victorian engine that made noises like a scratchy old
record player." (87-88). Kirschenbaum attempts to construct a grammatology of the hard drive next: "Here is my list: it is random access; it
is a signal processor; it is differential (and chronographic); it is volumetric; it is rationalized (and atomized); it is motiondependent;
it is planographic; and it is nonvolatile (but also variable)." (89) THis list assists in assembling a dialectic of the computer which is 
not based on preternatural explanations of the hard drive.
