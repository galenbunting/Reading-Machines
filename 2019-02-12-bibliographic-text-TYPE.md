Title: "Now Is The Time For All Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country"

tags: [bibliographic annotation, fieldbook]

author: Galen Bunting 


The sentence I used to title this fieldbook entry is literal filler text. It appears in various typing fieldbooks throughout the 19th and 
20th century, in order to attain speed while learning to use the early Remington. This typing test was just one way to mediate the divide 
between technologies of longhand writing and the technology of the typewriter. All the texts for this week discussed how to mediate 
divisions between technologies, through compositing, through type to typewriters, and from typewriters to word processors. 

As "A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy: A Visit to the Victoria Printing Press"  asserts, "let your education have been what it may, even classical
and mathematical, the printer's alphabet is unknown to your studies, and you must learn once more your A B C." As well as discussing the 
divide between knowledges which printing requires, "A Ramble" makes the arguement that only women should be compositors, arguing for a 
division between the sexes by different offices, that composing should be women's work, while men take the roles of pressmen. 

The Victoria Printing Press provided valuable work for women, as Emily Faithfull, its founder, intended. In its publications, it provided 
examples of the valuable work which women performed as compositers for the press. "Women Compositors" states the argument in succinct 
terms: "Let this fact speak for itself, together with another equally important-namely, that the Victoria Press is already self-
supporting, which is much as can generally be said of any business scarcely eighteen months old... the argument that the wages of 
men will be reduced by the introduction of women into the business, was also urged against the introduction of machinery." In this 
argument, the English Woman's Journal presented an argument against those who would oppose the introduction of women as compositors in 
the print shop. In structuring their argument, the editors also place women in comparison with machinery, urging their contemporaries 
to adjust to the times. 


In "Introduction: It Is Known" and "Word Processing as a Literary Subject" by Matthew Kirschenbaum, writing and how it is produced by writers is figured as an object of study and analysis. George R.R. Martin's use of WordStar provides an example of how writers use
technology in varying ways to create art: "Martin’s response brought home to viewers that we can become habituated to something like a piece of software just as we do a favorite pen or a particular weight of paper" (16). The fact that technology itself has materiality, 
has substance, has an effect on the words we write, was not surprising to me at all. When I'm not reading, I'm a writer, and sometimes, 
I moonlight as a creative writer. I've used many different kinds of pens, and used to write exclusively in longhand: I made the
transition to computers under protest in the 8th grade. Over the past week, my preferred computer, a Lenovo Flex 3, crashed and the
motherboard finally broke, after three faithful years. I'm composing this annotation on a tiny portable Dell laptop, which I'm borrowing: the click of the keys reminds me that this material keyboard is different, which sometimes jars me out of my natural rhythm. As a result, the work I've written while using this computer sounds different as well: my own work sounds staccato and disjointed to me. 
Krischenbaum goes on to argue that "A literary history of word processing must therefore acknowledge not only the hybrid, heterogeneous nature of both individual persons and their personalities, but also the highly complex scene of writing (and rewriting) that we observe today, one where text morphs and twists through multiple media at nearly every stage of the composition and publication process." (45) 

In studying literature, the history of word processing can assist in judging how authors compose and edit their work. 
The example of T.S. Eliot writing *The Waste Land* on three different typewriters stands out, as does the example of Neal 
Stephenson writing the Baroque Trilogy in longhand, transcribing his work via Emacs, and then hand-tooling a program in LISP to 
set his work in the industry standard QuarkXPress. In knowing the shifting technologies used to create words, we as readers and 
scholars can interpret literary work through a lens of materiality.

Finally, Ellen Cushman's "'We're Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century': The Cherokee Syllabary, Peoplehood, and
Perseverance" argues that Sequoyah's system of syllabary which he developed for the Cherokee people represents not only an intentional 
shift away from English, but that scholars "overlooked the possibility that Sequoyah might have known more English and had more facility with letters than they may have wanted to believe"- this belief gestures towards intentional oversight, that scholars ignored the fact that Sequoyah deliberately chose to eschew the English alphabet in creating a system of writing which stands apart from an alphabet. In fact, to understand this system of technology through the rules of an alphabet is to obscure its meaning. Cushman argues that "Sequoyah was literate in English, he rejected the influence of the alphabet and the English language as he developed the Cherokee writing system. When seen as a writing system in its own right—one that is read, written, and codifies the Cherokee language—Sequoyan reveals linguistic logics that continue today to contribute to Cherokee peoplehood." The Cherokee syllabary exists as a powerful tool of
peoplehood which stands apart from the English alphabet: when teaching Cherokee in Oklahoma, it is important to separate it from the alphabet as a mode of writing, and to treat it as its own technology.
