Title: "Now Is The Time For All Good Men to Come to the Aid of Their Country"

tags: [bibliographic annotation, fieldbook]

author: Galen Bunting 


The sentence I used to title this fieldbook entry is literal filler text. It appears in various typing fieldbooks throughout the 19th and 
20th century, in order to attain speed while learning to use the early Remington. This typing test was just one way to mediate the divide 
between technologies of longhand writing and the technology of the typewriter. All the texts for this week discussed how to mediate 
divisions between technologies, through compositing, through type to typewriters, and from typewriters to word processors. 

As "A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy: A Visit to the Victoria Printing Press"  asserts, "let your education have been what it may, even classical
and mathematical, the printer's alphabet is unknown to your studies, and you must learn once more your A B C." As well as discussing the 
divide between knowledges which printing requires, "A Ramble" makes the arguement that only women should be compositors, arguing for a 
division between the sexes by different offices, that composing should be women's work, while men take the roles of pressmen. 

The Victoria Printing Press provided valuable work for women, as Emily Faithfull, its founder, intended. In its publications, it provided 
examples of the valuable work which women performed as compositers for the press. "Women Compositors" states the argument in succinct 
terms: "Let this fact speak for itself, together with another equally important-namely, that the Victoria Press is already self-
supporting, which is much as can generally be said of any business scarcely eighteen months old... the argument that the wages of 
men will be reduced by the introduction of women into the business, was also urged against the introduction of machinery." In this 
argument, the English Woman's Journal presented an argument against those who would oppose the introduction of women as compositors in 
the print shop. In structuring their argument, the editors also place women in comparison with machinery, urging their contemporaries 
to adjust to the times.
