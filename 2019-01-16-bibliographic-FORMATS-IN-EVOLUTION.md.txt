Title: "FORMATS IN EVOLUTION"

author: Galen Bunting
All the media we read or viewed for this class demonstrated a common theme of evolution and change. A quote which 
illustrates this common theme appears in the introduction of Amaranth Barsuk's *The Book*: "Rather than inscribing a 
teleological story of ever-improving legibility, distribution, and engagement, the book's mutations tell us about our 
highly contingent cultural ideals of authorship and art" (xiv). In this quote, Barsuk links books to the way in which 
biological evolution proceeds. Her illustration highlights a common misconception regarding evolution: that it always 
serves to further and underline a higher rung of ascension, working towards the idealized apex of humankind: a teleological 
outcome, that is to say, purpose-based. A common misconception regarding evolution lies in misinterpreting the phrase 
"survival of the fittest." Biological evolution does not proceed in a teleological fashion: instead, evolution represents 
the ability to mutate, to change in order to survive long enough to pass on one's DNA to one's descendants. In a similar 
fashion, the technological history of the book is easily misinterpreted as fulfilling a teleological goal. Barsuk recounts 
the history of the book as a mutating thing which changes to survive and pass on the information, not teleologically, but 
illustrative of how WE change our ideals of what art means and what authorship means. 

As Barsuk argues in her chapter "The Book As Object," such ideals are often based on what technological forms we possess. 
She argues, "Content does not simply  necessitate its form, but rather writing develops alongside, influences, and is 
influenced by the technological supports that facilitate its distribution" (3). It is the technology that shapes our 
experience of a given text, limiting what that text can do. Barsuk traces the evolution of clay *bullae*, or counting 
tokens, in 8500-3000 BCE Sumeria to the reshaping of such clay accounting tokens into clay tablets: the medium shaped the 
message, as the reeds and clay tablets used would not permit pictographs, requiring Sumarians to create a reduced phonetic 
character set. Similarly, Egyptians used the material most available to them: the *cyperus papyrus* plant, which was easily 
sliced into green, sticky sheets, which could be layered, dried, and made into scrolls. Barsuk notes that the wide, even 
strokes of hieroglyphic writing could very likely been a way to avoid piercing through the thin paper. it also facilitated 
new methods of organization, as author names and tables of content could be placed on the outside edge of the scroll, a 
finding aid that also became integrated into the codex (17). When parchment was developed in Greece and Rome around 1600 
BCE, it was produced from animal hide, was much smoother than papyrus, allowed one to write clearly on both sides, and 
could be created anywhere animals lived, unlike papyrus which could only be made of *cyperus papyrus* stalks. However, as 
Barsuk points out, parchment did not immediately replace papyrus, although it was more convenient for many locales. 
In a similar fashion, Chinese *jiance* was produced from the material most available, bamboo. This material also shaped 
how the medium could be conveyed: writing from top to bottom is a reflection of the medium, as bamboo strips were usually 
cut so thin that only one character per line was permitted. Even after the invention of paper circa 105 CE, bamboo was 
still used alongside paper, until an imperial decree from Emperor Huan Xuan put an end to bamboo books. South American 
*kuipu* records in the form of knots tied into cloth string. The secrets of *kuipu* were closely guarded, especially after 
Spanish colonialism in the sixteenth century. *Kuipu* also reflect medium: the wool of alpaca and llamas provided the 
material for these texts. In all of these historical examples of texts, the available medium shaped the technology of the 
book.

The documentary "Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu" also shows a moment of evolution: the night of July 1, 1978, the last night that 
the New York Times was produced using hot type. Linotype machines poured hot lead into a mold, to produce a line of type, 
or line'o type. These lines of type would then be arranged into columns, which would then be assembled onto forms, in the 
shape of the newspaper. Before the electronic age, Linotype machines were the most accelerated way of assembling newspapers 
in accessible, expedient ways. They were responsible for widely available print culture before computers. From fourteen to
 a thousand lines a minute, both processes are intended to speed the flow of information. As Meredith McGill suggests, 
"Format is a rare instance of a technical term that applies in similar ways to both old and new media, the production and 
circulation of books and of information that travels across a networked infrastructure" (671). These formats changed 
drastically, but both serve to store and transmit information in different ways, but using the technology which best 
serves the required task.

Evolution also forms a central theme in Octave Uzanne's "The End of Books," published in 1894. In this essay, during a meeting 
of the Royal Society, the speaker proposes how books might look a hundred years into the future. He argues that "If by books 
you are to be understood as referring to our innumerable collections of paper, printed, sewed, and bound in a cover announcing 
the title of the work, I own to you frankly that I do not believe...that Gutenberg’s invention can do otherwise than sooner or 
later fall into desuetude as a means of current interpretation of our mental products." He supports his argument by pointing 
to the fatigue the eye experiences when reading, the success of the phonograph, and Edison's kinotoscope, which show a moving 
image. In his prospective technology of the future, the speaker imagines a metamorphasis of the book from "collections of paper" 
into phonographs which can be easily carried, stored, and used to match the newly available technology. However, the vision he 
paints of the future is by no means a future without books- instead, it is a future in which the medium of texts takes a new 
technological form as technology changes. 

As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues in "The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future is a Memory," as we attempt to imagine the technology 
of the future, it may be more effective as we face the "bleeding edge of obsolescence" to ask "what was new media? and what 
will it be?" (148). The memory which we associate with new media is representative of our desire to archive the ephemeral 
digital past completely, down to instances of posting our less polished and even nasty moments to Facebook. Chun argues 
that we conflate the storage of new media with memory, crossing the mechanical with the biological to create a kind of 
ideological cyborg or chimera. Chun goes on to argue that memory is active, not static, thus it is more effective to 
concieve of new media as based in time, not space. New media's attempt to archive the ephemeral is an attempt to store 
memory, not to let it escape. Therefore, as we examine new technology, it is useful to imagine the tasks we try to accomplish 
through this medium as an extension of our needs and desires.
