Title: Rogue Literacy

We are surrounded by texts, visible and invisible. The texts for this week speak to this intertextuality which is embedded throughout our 
world, by design. Not only text, but code (which may be read as a kind of text) constitutes the scripts which allow our smartphones, our 
fire alarms, and our computers to continue functioning. These texts all invite us to consider how these texts capture both us and the media
forms which we interact with, from 

Denis Tenen discusses how "code equals code" in "Computational Poetics: An Introduction" and "Metaphor Machines." 
Tenen describes the interconnected code of the fire alarm in his house, which in turn is governed by the U.S. National Fire Alarm Code: 
"I am at home, but I also receive an alarm notification on my mobile phone. Along with monitoring apps that help make my home "smarter," 
the phone contains most of my library. I often pick it up to read a book. The phrase "reading a book," however, obscures a number of metaphors
for a series of odd actions" (1). He describes the act of reading a book through the mode of one's smartphone, through defamiliarized description
which allows his reader to think through the odd nature of using the same description ("reading a book") to describe both reading on one's 
smartphone and reading via a paper-ink-and-glue codex form. Tenen then argues that we now find ourselves in a moment of unique expediency: 
a "position of selective asemiosis: the loss of signification" (2). Tenen identifies this lack of signification in the form of plain text file 
formats, which Tenen argues "identifies a file format and a frame of mind," since it contains nothing but a "pure sequence of character codes'"(3). 
Plain text is transcribed text which is intended to be faithful to the original source while remaining easier to read than the original. As an 
encoder for the Women Writers Project, these editorial stances guide much of my work for the project, as the texts are intended to be easily 
accessible while preserving the features of the original document. Tenen argues, "I mean to build a case for a kind of a systematic minimalism 
when it comes to our use of computers, a minimalism that privileges access to source materials, ensuring legibility and comprehension"(3). 
Tenen also explains that in digital file formats, an invisible layer of information exists to remain in line with codes such as 
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1996. The technological control of digital books requires us, as scholars, to "perceive the mechanisms of 
its codification" (3). The example he gives of a friend who wished to lend him a digital book and asked why he could not serves to illustrate 
the mechanisms we assume concerning print books: that they are transferrable and easily shared (4-5). We have only begun to understand how 
digital books function as textual space: Tenen argues that " Just as literary scholarship cannot survive without awareness of its computational present,
the design of computational platforms cannot advance without greater awareness of its cultural contexts." (7). The books and papers scattered on 
our desks and tables become invisible as physical media in their mundanity: "Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically 
perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement. Estrangement arrests material concealment. Exile allows the displaced to 
once again transform habituated media into meaningful information." (9). Digital media can become obscured because of its apparent remoteness: 
in order to counter this, Tenen uses "a similar sense of estrangement when it comes to our use of technology." (10). Through a Marxist reading 
of dead metaphors, Tenen effects a dialectic practice of reading and making digital texts plain. Digital media does not hide the author: 
"Although it is difficult to find specific parties responsible for massive spam campaigns or to credit individual Wikipedia writers, 
spammers do routinely find themselves in court just as notable Wikipedia contributors receive 'barn stars' in recognition of their efforts" (14).

In his chapter "Metaphor Machines," Tenen argues that we utilize machines every day which use fuzzy logic: "Like good theater, we experience
the machine in immersion, suspending disbelief" (23).
