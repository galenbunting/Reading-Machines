We are surrounded by texts, visible and invisible. The texts for this week speak to this intertextuality which is embedded throughout our 
world, by design. Not only text, but code (which may be read as a kind of text) constitutes the scripts which allow our smartphones, our 
fire alarms, and our computers to continue functioning. These texts all invite us to consider how these texts capture both us and the media
forms which we interact with, from 

Denis Tenen discusses how "code equals code" in "Computational Poetics: An Introduction" and "Metaphor Machines." 
Tenen describes the interconnected code of the fire alarm in his house, which in turn is governed by the U.S. National Fire Alarm Code: 
"I am at home, but I also receive an alarm notification on my mobile phone. Along with monitoring apps that help make my home "smarter," 
the phone contains most of my library. I often pick it up to read a book. The phrase "reading a book," however, obscures a number of metaphors
for a series of odd actions" (1). He describes the act of reading a book through the mode of one's smartphone, through defamiliarized description
which allows his reader to think through the odd nature of using the same description ("reading a book") to describe both reading on one's 
smartphone and reading via a paper-ink-and-glue codex form. Tenen then argues that we now find ourselves in a moment of unique expediency: 
a "position of selective asemiosis: the loss of signification" (2). Tenen identifies this lack of signification in the form of plain text file 
formats, which Tenen argues "identifies a file format and a frame of mind," since it contains nothing but a "pure sequence of character codes'"(3). 
Plain text is transcribed text which is intended to be faithful to the original source while remaining easier to read than the original. As an 
encoder for the Women Writers Project, these editorial stances guide much of my work for the project, as the texts are intended to be easily 
accessible while preserving the features of the original document. Tenen argues, "I mean to build a case for a kind of a systematic minimalism 
when it comes to our use of computers, a minimalism that privileges access to source materials, ensuring legibility and comprehension"(3). 
Tenen also explains that in digital file formats, an invisible layer of information exists to remain in line with codes such as 
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1996. The technological control of digital books requires us, as scholars, to "perceive the mechanisms of 
its codification" (3). The example he gives of a friend who wished to lend him a digital book and asked why he could not serves to illustrate 
the mechanisms we assume concerning print books: that they are transferrable and easily shared (4-5). We have only begun to understand how 
digital books function as textual space: Tenen argues that " Just as literary scholarship cannot survive without awareness of its computational present,
the design of computational platforms cannot advance without greater awareness of its cultural contexts." (7). The books and papers scattered on 
our desks and tables become invisible as physical media in their mundanity: "Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically 
perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement. Estrangement arrests material concealment. Exile allows the displaced to 
once again transform habituated media into meaningful information." (9). Digital media can become obscured because of its apparent remoteness: 
in order to counter this, Tenen uses "a similar sense of estrangement when it comes to our use of technology." (10). Through a Marxist reading 
of dead metaphors, Tenen effects a dialectic practice of reading and making digital texts plain. Digital media does not hide the author: 
"Although it is difficult to find specific parties responsible for massive spam campaigns or to credit individual Wikipedia writers, 
spammers do routinely find themselves in court just as notable Wikipedia contributors receive 'barn stars' in recognition of their efforts" (14).

In his chapter "Metaphor Machines," Tenen argues that we utilize machines every day which use fuzzy logic: "Like good theater, we experience
the machine in immersion, suspending disbelief" (23). We call the act of processing text via smartphone "reading," when in fact the process 
of reading smartphones requires chains and chains of code: "What originates from (1) the keyboard as the mechanical action of a switch
becomes (2) an electric signal that (3) leaves electromagnetic marks in computer memory, which (4) morph into phases of liquid crystal on-
screen, leaving behind (5) letters that emanate outward as light." (24). Such an interaction with reading creates a simulacrum: "simulation... without a referent" (25). Tenen tries to interrupt this metaphor of the computer in this chapter. He deconstructs this
metaphor through cognitive metaphor theory (26), since metaphors  perform  mappings from one domain to another (29). How does the interface 
of the "computer desktop" function? Tenen argues that in fact computer design manifests "what is called skeuomorphic design, by which screen
reading retains the ornaments of print" (38). Computer trashcans do not delete a document completely from a computer's desktop, and the earmarks of a digital document changes based upon its platform. The mimesis of the digital document places the burden of transference upon 
the reader, who must adjust to the medium of the digital platform (39). Before the 1980s, Alan Turing explained the interaction between a person 
and a machine in light of a dialogue, or conversational programming (43). However, computers only recongized a limited number of words, as in 
Colossal Cave Adventure (45). The symbolic notation of later coding reflected Leibniz's system of symbolic notation which originated with 
his calculus: "the exact nature of a thing briefly and, as it were, picture it." (46). It is important to consider the mimetic nature of 
computer programming: "Media mediate. But they also grow opaque through habituation." (52). 

Similarly in Jerome McGann's "The Textual Condition," he describes himself as an April fool, as he has lost his speech due to his computer 
crashing. He began systematically counting the texts he intended to analyze, sitting down at his computer, and writing. The next day, the machine delivers its worst message: "BDOS ERROR." Just as his computer freezes, McGann freezes, only able to mash the Return key ineffectually, unable to keep his computer from corrupting his file. "I will eventually run the corrupted file through my recovery programs 
and get back, in return for my trouble, fragmented bits of those once beautiful sentences and fragments. I wish my machine were alive. I
would like to kill it" (92). This frustration, this refiguring of the computer state in his own body, this response to a lack of control by imagining his computer as a living thing which can be killed. However, the computer error guides McGann to reformulate his thoughts, assembling definitive statements which do not reach the same conclusions as before. This textual instability represents a mechanical interference which fundamentally changes McGann's final product, the text which we are reading (94). As McGann argues, we are beyond mere writing in our current textual condition. 

Meanwhile, Sydney Shep asks in "'Smiley, you’re on candid camera': Emoticons & Pre-Digital Networks", "Why then, after some four hundred years of print’s visible language has the smiley or emoticon been introduced?" While the immediacy of netiquette sometimes requires the use 
of the smiley to break the ice, Shep also asks the question, "But what do we make of earlier experiments in expressive typography"? 
Personified typography has existed throughout print history, as Shep points out. Shep draws our attention to an example of early expressive 
typography from examples in The British and Colonial Printer and Stationer, located in the  "Mems from our File" (a title which immediately 
makes me think of the term "meme," a circulated artifact of memory), both in issues from February 16, 1882, and March 2, 1882. 
These "funny compositors' portraits" were previously circulated in Puck, which ran the four emoticons in its March 30, 1881 edition. Shep 
then argues that nineteenth century printing journals  "connected printers in a 'trans-imperial discourse of colonialism' and helped to produce an 'imagined geography of empire'". Efforts to trace the source of the internet smiley remain illusive: while Kevin Mackenzie is 
credited with the tongue-in-cheek smiley, Harlan Ellison suggested that science fiction contributors of the 1940s and 50s routinely punctuated their prose with a simple sideways smile framed by quotes: ")". Theodore Adorno anthropomorphizes punctuation marks in 
Noten zur Literatur / Notes to Literature. Fahlman’s creation of the smiley was represented by an email exchange to create a design solution
a communication problem amongst the computer science bulletin board community at Carnegie Mellon University, when jokes online were hard to 
discern from literal emails. The solution? An asterisk in the subject line. This narrative is a remarkably human impact on computer communication. 

In the 2009 webcomic *Homestuck,* wherein a group of friends end the world and summon a new one through playing a beta copy of a computer
game, each character communicates with the others through an imaginary instant messaging service. 
(The webcomic concluded in 2016, if one does not count multiple epilogues and updates via SnapChat, and entails more than 8000 pages and
800,000 words). As the story progresses, the four friends are trolled by twelve internet trolls, who turn out to be an alien race who have
played the game in a different timeline. Each of the friends (and their trolls) are identified by a "quirk," or internet accent formed by a
combination of emoticons, internet slang, textspeak, and text colors. This experiment in voice attests to the humanizing effect of smileys
and the impact of internet culture upon media creation.

Rita Raley's "TXTual Practice" asks the question, "are text messages displayed on large video screens or mobile variable message signs,  or  projected on building facades or on open ground in public squares, meaningful or not meaningful?" (5). She considers public art installations 
which utilize text messages to consider how this public art functions as "scenes of reading and writing that are particular to the moment of
ubiquitous mobile media and that make visible certain transformations that are occurring in our relationship to text in the ordinary sense
of linguistic signs." (7). She calls this dialetic "TXTual practice,"
