Title: "PRINT CULTURE/INTERNET CULTURE/THE PRINTING PRESS"
tags: [bibliographic annotation, fieldbook]
author: Galen Bunting

In his *Autobiography,* Benjamin Franklin establishes his proclivity for books in the second chapter. In this chapter alone, he lists 
the following texts: 

+ *The Pilgrim's Progress* by John Bunyan, which he tells us came in separate little volumes
+ R. Burton's *Historical Collections*, which he tells us are small chapmen's books, divided into 50 volumes
+ Books in polemic divinity from his father's library 
+ Plutarch's *Lives*
+ DeFoe's "Essay on Projects"
+ Dr. Mather's *Essays to do Good*
+ The *Spectator*

Out of these books, he is restricted to books which are housed in his father's library and books which he buys himself. 

These small texts mark a change in printing which Amaranth Borsuk marks as well: "The early years of the printed codex thus mark both 
an important technological shift (the mechanical reproduction of text) and a philosophical one in terms of how we relate to books. At 
this point they became the intimate spaces we now expect them to be" (84). 

+ How does Franklin approach these books? As texts? As technology? As content? What defines a "good" or "useful" book for Franklin?

Franklin implies that this "bookish inclination" is unusual and unexpected, especially for a boy of his age. He lists another boy in town 
by the name of John Collins, and describes the friendly debates which the two boys have: "Three or four letters of a side had
passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the
printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances.
I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement."

"Franklin explains that he taught himself rhetoric by encountering an issue of the *Spectator*: I took some of the papers, and, making 
short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the 
 papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand." 

Borsuk notes, "We should remember that the ability to mark up a text to this degree is an effect of codex form" (89).

+ In these early debates, how does one see the question of content versus form emerging? How does form enable content, or render content 
more accessible to a reader or audience? 
+ How does Franklin define what it means to be bookish through these references? 

Across chapters two through seven, Franklin lists an assortment of texts, including  
 + Tryon's *Health's Grand Preservative; or, The Women's Best Doctor*
 + Cocker's book of Arithmetick
As Elizabeth L. Eisenstein argues in "An Unacknowledge Revolution Revisited," the power of the press to standardize texts created a regulatory power which could result in fines at times (as in the case of the Wicked Bible of 1631) (95-96), whereas handwritten texts enabled the piracy of texts.  + Seller's and Shermy's books of Navigation
 + Xenophon's *Memorable Things of Socrates*
 + Greenwood's *English Grammar*
 + Locke *On Human Understanding*
 + *The Art of Thinking* by Messrs. du Port Royal
 + James Franklin's *New England Courant*
 + DeFoe's *Robinson Crusoe*
 + DeFoe's *Moll Flanders*
 + DeFoe's *Religious Courtship* 
 + DeFoe's *Family Instructor*
 + Richardson's *Pamela*
 After running away from his apprenticeship in Boston, fleeing the beatings of his brother, Franklin encounters a man in
ownership of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress as he crosses the bay to Philadelphia: "finely printed
on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it has been
translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book..." 
  
+ How is Franklin aware of the way in which texts circulate here? 

+ In discussing print and the making of print, Franklin judges what constitutes a bad press("Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press, and one small, worn-out font of English,"), a bad apprenticeship ("My brother was passionate,
and had often beaten me") and bad fellow pressmen ("Five shillings was demanded of me by the
compositors. I thought it an imposition, as I had paid below...I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered
as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief done me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my
matter, etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room"). Lisa Gitelman argues that *print culture* as a definition "should embrace the customs and practices that evolved within Western printing establishments, among the men and women who have, since the 1450s, specialized in the technological reproduction of textual materials. Print culture is at least the culture of printers, in other words, consolidated as such by the guild and apprenticeship systems, for instance, as well as by emergent social and economic norms that worked to structure printers as a class of actors in relation to other actors: authors and booksellers, yes, but also institutions like church and state" (186). How does Franklin either challenge or continue this definition of print culture? Do his judgements in the 
*Autobiography* do anything to alter this definition? In what other places does Franklin define print culture?

+ In the introduction to *Too Much to Know: Managing Scholarly Information before the Modern Age,* Ann M. Blair argues that reference books added a novel way to control information overload: such books included dictionaries, quotation books, translation books, and operated through the technology of the index, as a way to manage the explosion of information which the Renaissance brokered. How do these reference books serve to challenge or expand our notions of what print culture was/is?

+ In Matthew Brown's article "Blanks: Data, Method, and the British American Print Shop," he argues for the value of ephemera in studying print culture: "In the colonial period, the key to printing success was job printing. As with Gutenberg and Church indulgences, so too did unbound ephemera drive print-house production. Single-sheet jobs such as legal forms or printed notices or almanacs or (by the eighteenth century) newspapers always took priority in a shop." These blanks served a powerful rhetorical function in everyday life: "performative language of an excessive sort, deictic language of specific media." Similarly, in Stephen Fry's *The Machine That Made Us,* he emphasizes that Gutenberg would not have begun with the Bible, as to do so would be quite a gamble of both time, money, and religion, but indulgences. How do we see these priorities taking place within the *Autobiographies*? How does this information challenge or uplift our idea of print culture?

+ Gitelman tells us that "In 1829, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that newspapers weren’t subject to copyright because they were so “fluctuating and fugitive,” changeable according to the frequency of their issue and the currency of their contents. In 1918, it elaborated that “hot” news itself can’t be copyrighted, even if the particularity of its expression can be. The codex and its contents are sluggish and stable, “cold” by comparison to noncodex artifacts: books are slow to bloom, as anyone will admit who has ever tried to write and get one published" (187-188). What were the implications of the lack of copyright for noncodex items?

+ As Elizabeth L. Eisenstein argues in "An Unacknowledged Revolution Revisited," the power of the press to standardize texts created a regulatory power which could result in fines at times (as in the case of the Wicked Bible of 1631) (95-96), whereas handwritten texts enabled the piracy of texts. How do we see differing standards for different print formats?

+ Marcy Dinus draws our attention to the ways in which the printing press was anthropomorphized as both a literary device and as an attestation of the human qualities which both proslavery and antislavery activists attributed to the machine, while debating the rights of people of African descent: "That the press was understood in early America as such a powerful agent of change suggests a recognition of both its amplificatory function—spreading words and ideas from a single source to many others, often across great distances—and the physical strength of the men behind these machines." How does an awareness of the mechanics of the press, along with Garrison's use of an index which included a white hand pointing, redefine the phrase "the power of the press"? 

+ When we survey the power of metaphor in discussing the printing press, Elyse Graham argues in "The Printing Press as Metaphor" that "when we use the printing press as a metaphor for changes in our information culture, we succumb to anachronism twice. First, this metaphorical use relies on a now-belated concept...By comparing changes in our information culture to changes that the printing press “created” in an earlier information culture, we open our claim to include a wide range of possible meanings, but in the process we drain the comparison of specific value. Second, and more importantly, by unreflectively using the printing press as a metaphor for changes in an information culture, we elide long-term shifts in ideology and material practice that may represent the most important forms of difference among various media systems." What might we use as metaphors for a similar semiotic power in describing the effects of information culture (as opposed to print culture)? Do we lose anything when we depart from the metaphor of the press? Graham uses some metaphors in approaching this idea, such as "the marketplace of ideas" and "the attention economy" of Silicon Valley. How do these metaphors serve to give additional meanings beyond the literal- in short, why use metaphor at all?
