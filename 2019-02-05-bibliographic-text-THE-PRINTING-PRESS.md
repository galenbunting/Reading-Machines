Post: Bibligraphic Entry 

In his *Autobiography,* Benjamin Franklin establishes his proclivity for books in the second chapter. In this chapter alone, he lists 
the following texts: 

+ *The Pilgrim's Progress* by John Bunyan, which he tells us came in separate little volumes
+ R. Burton's *Historical Collections*, which he tells us are small chapmen's books, divided into 50 volumes
+ Books in polemic divinity from his father's library 
+ Plutarch's *Lives*
+ DeFoe's "Essay on Projects"
+ Dr. Mather's *Essays to do Good*
+ The *Spectator*

Out of these books, he is restricted to books which are housed in his father's library and books which he buys himself. 

These small texts mark a change in printing which Amaranth Borsuk marks as well: "The early years of the printed codex thus mark both 
an important technological shift (the mechanical reproduction of text) and a philosophical one in terms of how we relate to books. At 
this point they became the intimate spaces we now expect them to be" (84). 

+ How does Franklin approach these books? As texts? As technology? As content? What defines a "good" or "useful" book for Franklin?

Franklin implies that this "bookish inclination" is unusual and unexpected, especially for a boy of his age. He lists another boy in town 
by the name of John Collins, and describes the friendly debates which the two boys have: "Three or four letters of a side had
passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the
printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances.
I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement."

Franklin explains that he taught himself rhetoric by encountering an issue of the *Spectator*: I took some of the papers, and, making 
short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the 
papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand." 

Borsuk notes, "We should remember that the ability to mark up a text to this degree is an effect of codex form" (89).

+ In these early debates, how does one see the question of content versus form emerging? How does form enable content, or render content 
more accessible to a reader or audience? 

Across chapters two through seven, Franklin lists an assortment of texts, including  
 + Tryon's *Health's Grand Preservative; or, The Women's Best Doctor*
 + Cocker's book of Arithmetick
 + Seller's and Shermy's books of Navigation
 + Locke *On Human Understanding*
 + *The Art of Thinking* by Messrs. du Port Royal
 + James Franklin's *New England Courant*
 + DeFoe's *Robinson Crusoe*
 + DeFoe's *Moll Flanders*
 + DeFoe's *Religious Courtship* 
 + DeFoe's *Family Instructor*
 + Richardson's *Pamela*
 
+ How does Franklin define what it means to be bookish through these references? 
 
After running away from his apprenticeship in Boston, and in crossing over the bay to Philadelphia, Franklin encounters a man in
ownership of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, "finely printed
on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it has been
translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book..." 

+ How is Franklin aware of the way in which texts circulate here?
