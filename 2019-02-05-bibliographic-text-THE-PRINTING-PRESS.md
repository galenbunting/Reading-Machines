Post: Bibligraphic Entry 

In his *Autobiography,* Benjamin Franklin establishes his proclivity for books in the second chapter. In this chapter alone, he lists 
the following books: 

+*The Pilgrim's Progress* by John Bunyan, which he tells us came in separate little volumes
+R. Burton's *Historical Collections*, which he tells us are small chapmen's books, divided into 50 volumes
+Books in polemic divinity from his father's library 
+Plutarch's *Lives*
+DeFoe's "Essay on Projects"
+Dr. Mather's *Essays to do Good*

Out of these books, he is restricted to books which are housed in his father's library and books which he buys himself. 
Franklin implies that this "bookish inclination" is unusual and unexpected, especially for a boy of his age.
