Title: "THE BLANK PAGE"

author: Galen Bunting

The theme of the invisible page runs through the readings for this week. The blank page is invisible, ubiquitous until its creation is noticed. 
In Herman Melville's "The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids," the printed page is invisible while in use by the affluent bachelors in London: they 
are all scholars, writers, or lawyers, voluminous users of the  page in their work. Melville's metaphor of paradise is compounded by his frequent references to 
the fact that the bachelor's apartment in which they meet to take their repast is upwards towards heaven, up a strange and winding stair. While at table, 
the bachelors quote comic poems, discuss the goings-on of the British Museum, and discuss law cases. In departing, our narrator tells us that some go 
off to neighboring apartments to "turn over the *Decameron* ere retiring for the night." In relating all of these events, our narrator does not consider the 
way in which the printed pages which he discusses with his comrades are created: in fact, Melville emphasizes how removed the bachelors remain from working-class 
and impoverished people: their rooms are full of old, snug, furniture, they have disposable income upon which to travel, and they are physically above the winding 
streets of London. In direct contrast, he places the girls who work at the paper mill: the road to the gorge is characterized "as within a Dantean gateway," and 
the mill itself is named the "Devil’s Dungeon paper-mill"- our narrator is a seed distributor, in need of more wholesale paper for his business, thus he hopes to 
make a business deal at this mill. The girls who work in the mill bear a great resemblance to the paper they process: "At rows of blank-looking counters sat 
rows of blank-looking girls, with blank, white folders in their blank hands, all blankly folding blank paper." The paper-mill is not a printing-press, which 
perplexes our narrator: while touring the factory, he asks his guide, Cupid, whether the paper is printed there: "You make only blank paper; no printing of 
any sort, I suppose? All blank paper, don’t you?" To this, Cupid responds, "Certainly; what else should a paper-factory make?" The maids are part of the machinery 
of the paper-mill, a fact which inspires guilt and pity in our narrator as he winces at their pale, unhealthy faces, especially as they tear apart rags which 
could be from the shirts of bachelors. The metaphor of Tartarus surrounds the paper-mill: it is invisible to our narrator until he tours it, and sees how 
inextricable human labor is from the page. 

The repetition of paper as a metaphor for human labor and society is imperative for Jonathan Senchyne's essay "Paper Nationalism: Material Textuality and 
Communal Affiliation in Early America." In the writing of Pastor M. Emory Wright, he expresses his desire for American nationalism to function as seamlessly as a 
paper-mill, uniting many disparate rags into one whole. In turn, Senchyne argues for the "idea of paper nationalism as a material textual alternative to print 
nationalism or print republicanism, a way of understanding how the materiality of paper, along with or separate from whatever might be written on it, can 
represent or construct communal and political affiliation." That is, the blank page and its production as a metaphor for nationalism can show how 
thinkers throughout the eighteenth century saw their own country reflected on the blank page as a means of striving for unification. Senchyne goes on to ask, 
"How does a metaphorical understanding of paper, developed in relation to a technical understanding of paper, recruit communities to both a material practice 
of papermaking that was beneficial to the private and public interests of the state and an ideological sense of unification?" While many scholars see the printed 
page as a means of tracing nation building, the blank page also appears as a metaphor for nationalism, thus it is important to consider how the 
production of paper served as a political engine. Joseph Addison’s Spectator for May 1, 1712 communicates a narrative of the materiality of the printed page, 
imagining how The Spectator provides multiple public spheres with political conversation and rhetoric. Senchyne borrows from Derrida to argue that the state 
constitutes a "paper machine" itself: Senchyne points to the shorthand of "undocumented" persons to highlight our dependence on paper today. In a very 
real sense, colonial America depended on the manufacture of paper: with the Stamp Act which mandated the taxation of paper, therefore to collect rags
for paper-making was a patriotic duty. Without paper, legal documents, political documents, newspapers, schools, and other political institutions would 
be hampered. 

Similarly, Senchyne argues in "Rags Make Paper, Paper Makes Money: Material Texts and Metaphors of Capital," paper performs an important task 
as a technology to create paper for money. Both James K. Paulding's 1815 *The History of the Little Frenchman and His Bank Notes: Rags! Rags! Rags!* and 
the American Sunday School Union's 1850 *Little Jim, the Rag Merchant: A Tale of Truth and Honesty* present an argument for how capital is represented by rags 
as metonomy for money itself. *The Little Frenchman* presents rags as a way of establishing a chain of debts without anything behind it: rags generate rags. 
Meanwhile, *Little Jim* was a story intended to show how rag-picking allowed a begger to obtain other rags: the rags of capital and wealth, a rags-to-rags story. 
Both stories constitute different messages about how technologies in creating paper money was perceived by their authors. 

In Bonnie Mak's "Architectures of the Page," the history of the page itself is front and center. Mak argues for "a critical analysis of its role in the 
transmission and preservation of knowledge – both within and without the codex" (10). The formation of the page itself has been shaped by cultural and historical 
forces over time, Mak argues. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to its formation, from the papyrus scrolls of the Nile, to the codex of today. Mak 
points to the papyrus scroll's formation as a site of importance: at one point, the papyrus scrolls become thicker and the papyrus used to make the scrolls becomes 
more coarse, indicating that the makers were responding to climate change along the Nile by using papyrus which would have been discarded before. Prose and poetry 
differ in layout acros paginae. The arrangement of the paginae itself indicates that the makers of such paginae wanted to guide the eye of the readers by layout of 
text and space to understand the message as the scroll was unfurled (12). Similarly, a wax tablet indicates where writing should occur, inside the boundaries of its 
frame it contains the layout of a page (13). The boundaries of a codex similarly frame the text, though its form permits a *recto* and *verso* page. 
Even for the blank pages of a codex, Mak argues, "The physical boundaries of the page have thus already been determined before any design of text or 
image has been set upon it" (14). The study of Scripture guided much of the codex's development, as writers arranged paragraphs and columns to facilitate 
easier reading of a text, to permit marginal notations for reference, and to permit further understanding: "The page became an intricate weaving of narratives 
as scholars and students read their standard texts while consulting the accompanying marginal and interlinear glosses"(16). In this way, Mak argues that the 
blank page, as well as the printed page, provides a boundary for knowledge and its transmission, while shaping the messages within. The blank page has always 
provided a form for text, Mak argues. As we study texts, it is imperative to consider the format and boundary which the blank page presents.
