Title: "WHAT IS A BOOK?" 


tags: [bibliographic annotation, fieldbook] 


author: Galen Bunting

A central theme I saw reflected in the readings from this week is best expressed in the form of a question. What do we mean when we say a "book," in its current 
formulation, and how has history shaped our conception of the paper, the leather, the glue, the ink, that may make up a book? 
A comedic example can be found in Charles Chesnutt's "Baxter's Procrustes," which is the story of a poet named Baxter who deceives the Bodleian Club by submitting 
his verses to be published, while printing a book which is in fact blank. The members of the club roundly praise and admire the skill of Baxter's poetry, 
without cutting the leaves of any of the volumes, and comparing the skill of the lines to the skill of the binding: "The setting," I replied judicially,
"is worthy of the gem. The dark green cover, elaborately tooled, the old English lettering, the heavy linen paper, mark this as one of our very
choicest publications. The letter-press is of course De Vinne's best, there is nothing better on this side of the Atlantic. The text is a beautiful, 
slender stream, meandering gracefully through a wide meadow of margin." In the case of Baxter's Procrustes, the text assumes a metonyomy with the binding: 
Baxter's adulating audience praise the binding of the book as a representation of the quality of the text inside. If the gentlemen of the Bodleian Club knew 
the origin of the poem's title, they might have had more suspicion: Procrustes is a figure from Greek mythology, a bandit who attacked passersby and forced them 
to conform to his iron bed by cutting off parts of them or stretching them. Given this reference, we could interpret the title of the sham poem to refer to the 
bed of the press as well: the leaves of books, too, are cut to accommodate the eyes of their readers. In the words of "A Cover Is Not The Book" from the 2018 film 
*Mary Poppins Returns,* " A cover is not the book/ So open it up and take a look." The book's cover is not the thing itself, that is to say, the book- but in the 
example of Baxter's Procrustes, we are asked to consider if a book's cover may become the thing itself. 

The question of whether the book is defined by its cover or by its text is also raised in Leah Price's *How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain*: 
she argues that it is important to consider "why do Victorian writers develop such a rich language in which to name the manual gestures of holding, turning, 
and handling, with no matching lexicon to match the mental act of reading?" (2). To investigate the history of reading in Victorian Britain "may help us 
understand the printed "before" against which so many twenty-first-century commentators measure their digital "after."(2). Placing texts in context with how 
we do or do not value books (or how we devalue certain kinds of books) can aid us in reading our current moment, especially given the Victorians' ideals of 
good and bad reading, especially in conceptualizing the debate of using "idealized printed texts as a stick with which to beat real digital ones" (2). These Manichean 
value judgements of what consituted "bad" ways to read a book was often classed and gendered, even when they seemed to lack such a cast: 
"The good reader—himself disembodied and unclassed—forgot what books looked like, weighed, and would fetch on the resale market; he also forgot how books
had reached his hands, and through whose, and at what price...Yet paradoxically, those acts of oblivion themselves became enmeshed in human relationships, 
since reminders of the book’s material attributes got delegated to persons less rich or male or Protestant than oneself." The illustration of a coachman checking 
the outcomes of recent races in the sports section of a newspaper becomes a bad example of reading, as does the example of a housewife or servant who knows exactly 
what kinds of paper can be used to wrap purchases or scrub floors. A "good" reader forgets the material binding of his book, abstracting it to a "text,"
while the "bad" reader knows exactly what constructs the same book. 

Meanwhile, Jessica Pressman argues that the text as abstracted from the codex is no longer a fixture of being "bookish": instead, it is part of its constitutive 
categorization. She argues that the "threat posed to books by digital technologies becomes a source of artistic inspiration and formal experimentation in the 
pages of twenty-first-century literature" in "The Aesthetic of Bookishness in Twenty-First-Century Literature." Such an aesthetic which fetishizes the 
power of a text, Pressman argues, "is more than a just a coincidence: it is an emergent literary strategy that speaks to our cultural 
moment." The fear of the death of the book elevates "good" ways of reading, ways which identify a book as a codex of ink and paper, bound in leather. As the 
cultural moment proliferates digital media and electronic literature as acceptable book formats, Pressman argues that "as the codex cedes its dominance as 
a form of information access to other media formats, book-bound content becomes more associated with the literary." Therefore, for the current moment, while 
books may remain in any format, Literature (and here I capitalize the term, to emphasize that it is an ideal) is only recognizable in the form of the codex, 
not an abstracted text, the Victorian ideal of the Reader flipped upon its head. 


The question of what we study when we study the history of the book is addressed in Robert Darnton's "What is the History of Books? Revisited." 
This question is addressed by a series of subsequent questions:

+ How do books come into being?
+ How do they reach readers?
+ What do readers make of them?

What we study when we study the history of books requires more specificity than Darnton had previously employed: he focused previously on six stages of
production: authors, publishers, printers, shippers, booksellers and readers. In this revisitation, Darnton argues that it is more complicated than he 
had previously thought. Darnton draws attention to paratexuality and intertextuality, best illustrated by the example he gives: French libel writing 
which repeats anecdotes, "culled from a large variety of the same sources. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, unlike today, "anecdote" meant 
"secret history"... Libels were cobbled together out of material scattered through the information systems of the *Ancien Regime.* To make sense of them, 
it is crucial to study the system itself-that is, to concentrate on intertextual combinations rather than on the book as a self-sufficient unit" (507). 
The recycled and refurbished histories of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries require more attention, he concludes. Finally, he focuses on comparative 
history as a means of understanding various trends throughout book history. How books were shaped varies from each historical moment, Darnton concludes. 

Finally, Johanna Drucker argues that while Darnton did pay attention to systemic focii, he "assumes the book is an a priori given, an object in circulation," 
and isolates himself to the codex as defining what a book is. She calls for research to develop a theory of biblio-alterity which would include forensic techniques, 
aesthetic analyses, study of political impacts, understanding of social values, and discussion of cultural practices. This theory would acknowledge that, since
"bibliography was established on the basis of western cultural book practices, its analytic and descriptive methods need to be rethought to serve a broader 
range of types and modes of communication." Therefore, the challenge Drucker presents to us is to think about what a future history of the book might appear 
if we began by formulating inclusion of New World writing such as indigenous glyphs, signs, quipu, and wampum as cornerstones of bibliographic study, not reifying 
the codex as the cornerstone of the history of books.
